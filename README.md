# Calcium sensor analysis

Codebase for the analysis in our paper *An updated suite of viral vectors for in vivo calcium imaging using intracerebral and retro-orbital injections*

### Overview

``sensor_analysis.ipynb``  
Contains the analysis for
- correlations between raw fluorescence and neuropil,
- signal-to-noise ratio, and
- signal intensity

for all the different calcium indicators.

``soma_axon.ipynb``  
Contains the analysis of the soma-axon pair correlations.
